- Add `Find-VaasMachine` to find machines by type or status.  The list of attributes to search by will increase over time.  `Find-VaasObject -Type Machine` can always be used as well.
- Add `Get-VaasMachine` to get machines by uuid, name, or get all.
- Update `Invoke-VaasWorkflow` output to include workflow id (wsClientId)
- Add machine creation functions `New-VaasMachine`, `New-VaasMachineIis`, and `New-VaasMachineCommonKeystore`.  These require PowerShell v7+ and have parallel processing.  `New-VaasMachine` is for basic machines with hostname, credential, and optional port, eg. Citrix and F5.
- Add machine types to $VenafiSession.MachineTypes when using `New-VenafiSession` for VaaS
- Add `Invoke-VenafiParallel` private function to easily execute operations in parallel.  Requires PowerShell v7+.
- Add argument completer to `New-VaasMachine -MachineType` and `Find-VaasMachine -MachineType` for dynamic tab-ahead list of machine types
- Add [PSSodium](https://github.com/TylerLeonhardt/PSSodium) as a nested module, required for machine creation functions
