- [#71](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/71), add group and event id validation to `Write-TppLog` as well as help updates
- Add the ability to access classes and enums outside the module
- Add paging to `Find-TppCertificate`, deprecation messaging for `-Limit` and `-Offset` in favor of PS standard `-First` and `-Skip`
- Update `Get-VenafiCertificate` to ensure empty values for some date properties don't cause an exception
