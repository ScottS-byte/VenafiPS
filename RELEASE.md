- Add docker image with each new build and [publish to dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/venafi/venafips-module).  Add the below environment variables recognition for use with docker image, but could be used outside of it as well.  This is great for ci/cd scenarios and more.
  - TPP_SERVER - TPP server url
  - TPP_TOKEN - TPP oauth token
  - VAAS_KEY - VaaS key
- Fix `Set-TppAttribute` not clearing a value.  You can now pass $null to clear an object's attribute value, [#119](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/119)
