- Add support for managing TLSPC Connectors via `Get-VcConnector`, `New-VcConnector`, `Set-VcConnector`, and `Remove-VcConnector`.  The old Connector functions, Get, New, and Remove, which were for managing Webhooks, have been renamed to more appropriately reflect their usage.  They are now `Get-VcWebhook`, `New-VcWebhook`, and `Remove-VcWebhook`.
- Add support for TLSPC EU region with `New-VenafiSession -VcRegion`.  The default is 'us' and accepts 'eu' as well.  This detail will be stored in the resulting session and vault if utilized.
- Update `Invoke-VcCertificateAction -Renew` to retrieve all existing CSR details, [#260](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/260), [#264](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/264).  Also update this function to return any missing/incorrect details when renewing.
- Add `Invoke-VcCertificateAction -Renew -Force` to override the default behavior of stopping when more than 1 common name is encountered.  Use of `-Force` will use the first common name found in the array.
- Update readme to remove deprecated -VaultMetadata parameter, [#256](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/256)
- Fix duplicate parameter error with `Get-VdcAttribute -All`, [#259](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/259)
- Update default value of `New-VcCertificate -ValidUntil` from 1 year to 90 days
